\b What type of log file is it?
\b0 \
\
	The log files consist of 5 Access logs and 6 Error logs (one is a duplicate so 5) , a Auth log and 	a Server Message log.\
\

\b What are the dates which are represented by the logs?
\b0 \
\
	The dates range from November 10th 2013 to December 10th 2013.\
\

\b How many unique users appear?
\b0 \
\
	I could go through all the these and get the exact number but that would not be very practical. 	The access log should have a summary report available, which is what I would use if I really 	wanted to know.\
\

\b What was the largest data export? and does it look out of the ordinary?
\b0 \

\f1 \cf0 	The largest data export is \'97 GET /sites/default/files/images/Daly.png HTTP/1.1  ( at 97598b
\f0 )  it is an i	mage and it does not seem to out of the ordinary.\

\cf0 \

\b What is the most common error found in the error logs?
\b0 \
\
	Error 403  Forbidden.\
\

\b Do you see anything which is out of the ordinary?
\b0 \
\
	A few things seem out of the ordinary, mostly from w00tw00t.at.blackhats.romanian.anti-sec:) 	HTTP/1.1\
\

\b Write a short synopsis of what you found in each file.
\b0 \
\
	The majority of the access logs are typical behavior, just logs on successful posts with a few 	failures sprinkled in - nothing really unusual to report there, or not that I can make out. The part that stands out immediately are on the error logs, where 	(w00tw00t.at.blackhats.romanian.anti-sec:) HTTP/1.1) is repeatedly trying to access the server config files from varying IP's. The auth log also has some suspicious activity, or really, not-so-suspicious and more blatantly obvious, with someone attempting to just 	brute-force the root password, starting on Dec 8th and continuing for several days.
